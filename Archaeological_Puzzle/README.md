The character R stands for “Reorient,” which reverses the numerical sequence of the message.
The character D stands for “Disassemble,” which removes the first element of the sequence.

Input
The first line contains the decoding instructions from the post-it consisting of characters ‘R’ and ‘D’. The length of
the instruction sequence is between 1 and 105 (inclusive).
The next line contains the number of values in the encrypted message, n (0 <= n <= 105).
The last line contains the encrypted message itself [y1,...,yn] , where (1 ≤ yi ≤ 100 ). The values are enclosed in a
set of square brackets (i.e., start with ‘[’ and end with ’]’). The individual values are separated by commas and
nothing else.
Output
A single line containing either the decrypted sequence or “error”. The resulting list should start with ‘[’ and end
with ’]’. The integers in the input and output list are separated by commas and nothing else.
