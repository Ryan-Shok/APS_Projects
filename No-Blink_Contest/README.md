In a no-blink contest, one contestant faces the other contestant in a match and the one who blinks first loses. All 2ˆS first year students were expected to participate. Because of flight delays due to some hurricane activity at the end of August, many students were not able to arrive on time. The organizers of the contest spent a lot of time selecting the pairs for initial round of matches (based on their roommate preferences specified in the college applications) and did not want to rearrange the entire contest last minute. Instead, they decided to allow free passes in cases when one of the contestants is missing:- If both contestants are present, then the regular no-blink match will happen.- If only one contestant arrived on time for the contest, they will be automatically declared a winner, i.e., get a free pass.- If no contestants arrived on time then there is no match between them.

Input:
Each test begins with two integers: 1 <= S <= 10 and 0 <= M <= 2ˆS. 2ˆS is the number of students originally
scheduled for the contest. M is the number of students missing. The next line contains M integers, denoting the
students who have not arrived. The students are numbered 1 to 2ˆS.

Output:
The number of free pass matches
