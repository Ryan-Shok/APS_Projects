Input
For simplicity, the entire input is given on a single line. It may consist of any sequence of characters. Each program
is at most 3000 characters.
Output
The program should print YES if the program is valid (from the point of view of matching brackets), or NO followed
by the character position (1-based) at which the first problem was detected if the program is not valid.
